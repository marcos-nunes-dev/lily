                Writing from the heart here. I've always tried to be my vulnerable, honest self in everything I do. So I wanted to provide you an update on what I am up to.

                You might of seen me around LinkedIn the past few years posting jobs in Brazil for US startups. The truth is, when I started, I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I was a white guy from California who started poking around blindly in a foreign country without a map or guidepost on how to find talent. Somehow I figured shit out, and over the past 4 years have placed about 120 Brazilians developers, UX/UI Designers, and data scientists in various US companies.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, I've done a ton of things over the years. Sold different SaaS solutions and products, and it was all good, but there was something about helping people find jobs that hit different. The idea of helping people in other countries feed their families just really made me feel good. I realized just not only how brilliant and innovative the people of Brazil were, but they were warm, accommodating, and supportive. Watching you all flourish and grow made me want to advocate and educate the US startup systems about the wonders of Brazil.

                As 2023 began, and the market turned, the sad reality was my business suffered badly. Pay offers became smaller and smaller, I could pay people less and less. Unemployment sky rocketed. I had to lay off my contractors. It broke my heart. You couldn't feed your families and frankly, I couldn't feed mine. I got sick. I was in the ER. My mental health deteriorated. I battled depression and suicide. I felt like a failure.
              </p>

              <p>
                It was the spring of 2024 where I started offering resume rewrites and interview Master Classes. It went well. I was teaching people in Brazil interview tips, resume highlights, and how to apply for the US job market. I felt purpose. People were telling me they were getting job offers. They felt their confidence rise.

                Full transparency, I plan on charging a VERY LOW membership fee. This isn't to get rich, but to support my family. I do various jobs from Uber to teaching English and I want to pour my heart and soul into this. I promise I will always provide value and never take you for granted.
              </p>

              <p>
                I plan to build transparently and ask for feedback. I will make myself as available as I humanly can because this is what I love.
